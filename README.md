Tiny Stash
===========

A TinyMCE plugin that greatly improves creating and adding items and trades to your course.

Features
--------

- Create items, drops, and trades in the editor
- The direct insert of codes means no messing around with copy and pasting
- The editor now displays what the embeded item or trade will look like rather than a cryptic shortcode.


Requirements
------------

- Block Stash 2.0.3 must be installed and enabled.
- Shortcodes filter must be installed and enabled.
- Moodle 4.1.2 or greater.

Getting started
---------------

### The editor

- Make sure that TinyMCE is set as your default editor
- As a teacher on a course, edit an activity or resource. TinyMCE will be the editor for areas where you can insert stash items and trades.
- Click the "insert stash item" button to open a dialogue.
- *Note*: The stash icon will not show up in the editor until you have added the stash block to that course.

#### If you are new to Stash

- Items: These are the things that your students are searching for. Items require a name and a picture.
- Drops: A drop allows an item to be placed in multiple different places with different attributes. e.g. You have a high traffic area on your course, and so you want your item to be available once only, but you have another more secret drop and as a reward you can pick up this item multiple times.
  - Drops have a location name for your benefit only. This is used to remind you were this item is located (if you in the general management screen).
  - This plugin will have a guess at a location name for your drop. You are free to change it to something else.
- Trades: This is a mechanism for removing items from the student and replacing them with other items. e.g. You have potatoes and oil items located for the student to collect. This trade will take the oil and potatoes and give back chips.
